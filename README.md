This information is very interesting and applicable to not just my career pivot but also to my lifestyle. I do a lot of work at my computer and have been noticing how it affects my back and legs negatively. Although I work out regularly, I also sit a lot. Here is a summary of the information posited in these sources. 
Sitting can increase the risk one has for colon and breast cancer. Also, prolonged sitting may impact one’s health by affecting the cardiovascular system by not allowing proper blood flow. Diabetes is a risk enhanced by sitting too much as well. 
In order to avoid health risks caused by prolonged sitting, regular intervals of standing up and moving about are recommended. The key is to not be sedentary. Sedentary behaviors for prolonged periods of time is what enhances the negative aspects of sitting. 
As an individual that spends much time sitting, I will definitely keep this in mind in the future. What might work for now is to set an alarm for every 30 minutes to develop a routine of standing and moving about in order to avoid health issues. After a while, as with any behavior, the time interval will become a natural habit and ultimately add to the enjoyment of my life.
